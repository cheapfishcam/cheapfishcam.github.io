  <p>"You meet a lot of wonderful people on the streets everyday without discovering how wonderful they are. People are inspiring.
Inspire people by writing about yourself here."</p>

  <p>The balls with open peer connections can only be a handful due to restriction bandwidth; call this subset of balls "the chosen balls". 
  As for the rest of the balls, it would be cool to show them (slightly transparent) but without peer connections; "the second balls". Then 
   "the third balls" are slightly more transparant and so on. For "the second balls", still show the (empty) leaflet popups opening and closing.</p>


  <p>Users can choose to be part of a group ball dance around a radio like in TF2.</p>

  <p>You can use this a way to help people develope ways to shake off their misery. You can show the balls of a country in turmoil in a way that 
makes people have a better grasp on the problems, and be in a better position to try to solve them. Another way of doing that 
is to give balls the ability to pull other balls; many balls can pull two fighting balls apart; possible application might be to fix the norther Ireland 
and Brexit problem.</p>

  <p>Volume of radio should decrease as ball moves away.</p>
